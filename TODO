Next main job:
    redo parsing so as to properly handle full grammar and morphology,
    and ensure frees are correctly associated with their positions.

    I'm currently unsure whether this should be done by using a camxes
    implementation as an external program, or by implementing camxes
    ourselves.

    Once this is done, we can think about handling UI and so on.

Support {sei sa'a} and {to'i}?

use to...toi in lojban for sides?

alternative tags mode, doing away with modals and non-logical sentence
connectives in favour of extra WithEventAs and TagRels?
    Nice idea, but I don't see how to handle complicated joik connected
    tenses; see notes/reductions.

option to render sumti (and tag, abstractor) connectives as quantifiers?

Pretty printing

illocution: ko etc

irrealis UI - allow a free as a selbri tcita, then current free handling
should get the scope right, and we can consider them as modal operators?
